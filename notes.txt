1. 
bar girl query (Q36)
expected... clustering will boost accuracy
'নিষেধাজ্ঞা' and 'নিষেধ' are identified as variants
2. 
in a few queries, there is a spelling mismatch
no way to make up for this
a very prominent issue with co-occurrence
eg ডান্স and ড্যান্স
মণিকা and মনিকা
3.
removed বার from the stop-word list (wreft Q36)
4. 
doc id 75359 -> incompatibility issue
5. 
added a function: rf.match_value()
word1, word2, occ(word2) -> 
intersection * e^(-symmetric diff) * log(occ) * exp(prefix match length)
if word1 is not in the prefix match cluster, it finds out the 'best fit'
eg for 'বিদ্যুৎ', it finds 'বিদ্যুত্'
6.
customization of bm score calculation
bm score = actual score * e^(-len(cluster))
7.
possibly relevant documents -> say the extended query: {t₁, t₂, ..., tₙ}
set of docs = union(doc ids where tᵢ occurs})
improvement in run-time
one illustration: Q50
without the above mentioned func - time 417.42
with the func - time 11.59
8.
র added to sw list

========================================================================
WHAT's NEW

0. reconstruction of rel_list
1. inclusion of words like ডান্সবার, লালুপ্রসাদ etc
2. best match: used for নাগাল্যন্ড, প্রতিরক্ষা
3. 1 + 2 used simultaneously: জলবিদ্যুত্
4. exclusion of useless glued-pieces: সেচপ্রকল্প, মাউন্টেনিয়ারিং 
(using co-occurrence values) 
5. so that 4 can be used, implementation of [0,1] scheme
6. the tanh classifier
6.1
reducing the prefix match cut-off to 50 % of the longest word
7. customization in bm score calculation: instance_weight
8. given a few words, prediction of more context-based terms:
8.1
expander-1: co-occurrence vector, element-wise mult
expander-2: probab(a term appearing in intersect) and its freq
8.2
expander-2 -> expander-3:
used for 'বাংলাদেশে রাজনৈতিক' pair
using one or two relevant doc as training set
9. run-time improvement: finding possibly relevant doc set
